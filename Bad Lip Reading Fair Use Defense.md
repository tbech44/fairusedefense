The goal of this argument is to address individually how each of the four (4) considerations taken into account when determining fair use according to 17 U.S. Code § 107 are used by the Bad Lip Reading videos posted on YouTube.  The specific video I am using for this excercise is titled [*"NFL 2016: Part One" — A Bad Lip Reading of the NFL*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-kGosnzvjU).  I chose an NFL edition of the series because the NFL and other American sports organizations are known for being especially posessive of the contents of their broadcasts.  If you've ever watched an NFL game, then this probably sounds pretty familiar to you: "This telecast is copyrighted by the NFL for the private use of our audience. Any other use of this telecast or any pictures, descriptions, or accounts of the game without the NFL’s consent is prohibited." TV networks (or any other broadcast or publication for that matter) can't even mention the words "Super Bowl" without having the rights specifically granted by the league. I'm probably in violation just for saying it here as an example.


The official law regarding fair use reads as following: "Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright."

The factors taken into account when determining whether a particular use of copyrighted materials is considered fair use include:


#### 1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes
____
The first thing that's looked at is how the media is being used.  Something that is used for educational purposes, for instance, is far more likely to be considered fair use than something that is made for the sake profit.

At first glance, things may not look good for *Bad Lip Readings* fair use argument.  Since their content is posted to YouTube and therefore earns them money from ad revenue, they are profiting from the use of the NFL's game footage.  Luckily, this is only a small part of what is looked at when determing fair use.

#### 2. The nature of the copyrighted work
----
The next thing considered when determining fair use is the nature of the work used.  This is important to the argument because it provides context.  For example, if someone is making a video reviewing an album, they might play snippets of songs from the album. The nature of the copyrighted work makes sense to use in that sense, which would help the fair use argument.

In this case, the work being used is official broadcast video from NFL football games and post-game interviews. The way that it is presented, though, has been changed so much from the original context.  It has been taken from a narrative that shows two teams playing a game of football, and turned into a series of short exerpts adapted for humor.  In fact, not a single actual football play is shown in the entirety of the video.

#### 3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole
----
The third consideration when it comes to fair use is how much of the copyrighted work is used in the new work that's created. There is not set parameter of how much is allowed to be used, but what *is* considered is the amount of the being used in relation with the size of the original work.

In the case of bad lip readings, the entire video is made up of NFL footage, however each individual scene is a few seconds out of footage that is usually around 3 hours long.  Also, each clip is from a different games, so comparatively the amount used is incredibly small compared to the full copyrighted material. In addition, while video from the games is being used, the audio is not.  In fact, the audio has not only been taken out, but has been replaced in a way that changes the meaning of the video substantially.  I believe this to be one of the strongest defenses that *Bad Lip Reading* has in a fair use argument.

#### 4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work
----

The final factor looked at when considering fair use is how the use affects the value of the original.  Would someone be less likely to purchase or use the original work because of this use of the content?  Would they be willing to pay less for it?  This is probably the most important factor considered because this is why the law exists.  The artist who creates something wants to be able to reap the profit they've earned with the successful execution of their idea.

This is another strong defense that *Bad Lip Readings* have in the fair use argument.  No one would be less likely to watch a football game because of this video.  The content has been altered so much that the context of the original video is completely lost.  Of course it's still obvious that these are NFL football players and teams who are in the middle of a game, but no further information about the games is presented.
